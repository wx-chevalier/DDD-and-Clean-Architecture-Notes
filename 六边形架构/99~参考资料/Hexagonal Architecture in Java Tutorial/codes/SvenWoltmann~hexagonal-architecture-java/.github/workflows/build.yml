        # We're building twice (takes only 2s) as otherwise, Sonar would complain:
        #   The following dependencies could not be resolved at this point of the build but seem to be part of the reactor:
        #   o ...
        #   Try running the build up to the lifecycle phase "package"
        #
        # If the "package" phase takes much longer in the future, this step and the previous one should be combined into one.
