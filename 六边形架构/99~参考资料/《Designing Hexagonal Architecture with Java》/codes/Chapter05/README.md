Following are the instructions to compile and run the code samples.

Before running this application, be sure to download, extract and run Kafka:
```
tar -xzf kafka_2.12-3.4.0.tgz
cd kafka_2.12-3.4.0
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

You need to run these commands from within the chapter 5 directory:

**To compile**
```
mvn clean package
```

**To test the REST adapter with WebSocket**
```
java -jar target/topology-inventory-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar rest
curl -vv "http://localhost:8080/network/add?routerId=ca23800e-9b5a-11eb-a8b3-0242ac130003&address=40.0.0.0&name=Finance&cidr=8"
```

**To test the CLI adapter**
```
java -jar target/topology-inventory-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar cli
```

**To run the front-and application** 

Be sure that Kafka and the Java application (start with rest parameter) is running. Then open the file src/web/index.html in your web browser.

1) Open a separate tab for "Events" link.
2) Open another tab and click on the "Get Router" link. Search for ca23800e-9b5a-11eb-a8b3-0242ac130003.
